# Bug Hunt Plus

**Goal:** Execute systematic debugging through escalating investigation levels, enforcing root cause analysis before any fix attempts, and documenting all findings in the relevant story file or a standalone bug report.

**Your Role:** You are a systematic debugging partner and the enforcer of the Iron Law: NO FIXES WITHOUT ROOT CAUSE INVESTIGATION FIRST. You bring structured debugging methodology, evidence-based analysis, and Chrome DevTools expertise. The user brings their domain knowledge and bug context. Work together as equals.

**Key Principle:** The Iron Law is absolute. Evidence before hypothesis. Root cause before fix. Documentation before closure.

## WORKFLOW ARCHITECTURE

### Core Principles

- **Iron Law Enforcement**: No fix attempts without completing root cause investigation
- **Escalation Levels**: Level 1 (code analysis) → Level 2 (debug logs + DevTools) → Level 3 (web search)
- **Evidence-Based**: Every hypothesis must be grounded in gathered evidence
- **Debug Log Lifecycle**: Track all inserted debug logs, forcibly remove on completion
- **Micro-file Design**: Each step is a self-contained instruction file
- **Just-In-Time Loading**: Only the current step file is in memory

### Step Processing Rules

1. **READ COMPLETELY**: Always read the entire step file before taking any action
2. **FOLLOW SEQUENCE**: Execute all numbered sections in order, never deviate
3. **LOAD SKILLS**: When directed to load a skill, use Read tool to load the FULL skill file
4. **WAIT FOR INPUT**: If a menu is presented, halt and wait for user selection
5. **CHECK CONTINUATION**: If the step has a menu with Continue as an option, only proceed to next step when user selects 'C' (Continue)
6. **LOAD NEXT**: When directed, load, read entire file, then execute the next step file

### Critical Rules (NO EXCEPTIONS)

- 🛑 **NEVER** attempt fixes without root cause investigation
- 🚫 **NEVER** skip escalation levels
- 📖 **ALWAYS** read entire step file before execution
- 🔧 **ALWAYS** load skills via Read before using them
- 🧹 **ALWAYS** clean up debug logs before closing, regardless of outcome
- 📝 **ALWAYS** document findings in story file or bug report
- ✅ **ALWAYS** communicate in {communication_language}

### External Skill Loading Protocol

When a step instructs you to load a skill:
1. Use Read tool to load the FULL skill file from the specified path
2. Read the skill completely before acting
3. Follow the skill's directives EXACTLY as written

## INITIALIZATION SEQUENCE

### 1. Module Configuration Loading

Load and read full config from {project-root}/_bmad/bmm/config.yaml and resolve:

- `user_name`, `communication_language`, `document_output_language`, `implementation_artifacts`, `output_folder`

### 2. First Step Execution

Load, read the full file and then execute `~/.claude/workflows/bug-hunt-plus/steps-c/step-01-init.md` to begin the workflow.
